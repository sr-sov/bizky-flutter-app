# Bizky 
is a Special Problem Project ([article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xw9Waz9bgkR3b7rKJxQ99NuLBHRvQdUQ/view?usp=sharing "Bizky's Journal Article")) I developed as an undergraduate in B.S. Computer Science at University of the Philippines Los Baños.

It is an Android financial management application, developed using Google’s Dart programming language with the Flutter framework, specifically targeted towards small and medium-sized enterprises in the Philippines. 

It is designed to provide an accessible information system that they need, but usually lack due to financial or usability constraints, to improve their business. The application functions as a point-of-sale system by
handling retail transactions through the application’s interface. By recording and synchronizing each transaction into a cloud database, it also functions as an inventory management system. Most importantly, Bizky allows administrators to monitor and manage the business through a mobile and real-time observation of the business via an interface, or a report generated by the application.
