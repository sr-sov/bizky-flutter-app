# bizky-flutter-app
Android App developed using Flutter


# Bizky 
is an online Android application, developed
using Google’s Dart programming language with the Flutter
framework, specifically targeted towards small and medium-
sized enterprises in the Philippines. It is designed to provide
an accessible information system that they need, but usually
lack due to financial or usability constraints, to improve their
business. The application functions as a point-of-sale system by
handling retail transactions through the application’s interface.
By recording and synchronizing each transaction into a cloud
database, it also functions as an inventory management system.
Most importantly, Bizky allows administrators to monitor and
manage the business through a mobile and real-time observation
of the business via an interface, or a report generated by the
application.
